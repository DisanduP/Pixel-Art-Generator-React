# Pixel Art Generator (React + Sass)

This repo is a small conversion of a vanilla HTML/CSS/JS Pixel Art Generator into React components and Sass.

Quick start

1. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

2. Run dev server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Files added

- `src/App.js` — main React component that replicates original UI and logic.
- `src/Pixel.js` — a Pixel component (present for future refactor).
- `src/styles.sass` and `src/Pixel.sass` — styles in Sass.
